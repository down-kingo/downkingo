      "description": "## Context\nCurrently, after downloading a video or image on Kingo (PC), the user doesn't have a native and quick way to transfer this content to their phone. Relying on the cloud (Google Drive/WhatsApp) is slow and unnecessarily consumes internet bandwidth.\n## Motivation\nCreate a \"zero friction\" experience where the user just points their phone's camera at Kingo and the download starts instantly via local network (P2P), taking advantage of the maximum Wi-Fi speed.\n## Problem\nTransferring large files from PC to mobile devices is a tedious process that usually involves USB cables or uploads to external services, which kills the agility of a download app.\n## Technical Proposal\nImplement an **Ephemeral Transmission Server** in Go:\n1. **Backend (Go):** \n   - Use `net/http` to start a temporary web server on a random port.\n   - Implement an **IP Discovery** system to identify the PC's address on the local network (e.g., 192.168.x.x).\n   - Serve the file di",

      "description": "## Context\nThe Kingo ecosystem needs a more fluid integration with the browser. Currently, the user depends on the clipboard monitor or manual copy/paste. The `kingo://` protocol scheme already exists in the code, but the \"single instance\" behavior has not yet been refined.\n## Motivation\nAllow the user to send videos to Kingo with just one click directly from YouTube/Instagram, without the need to copy links to the clipboard. This makes the workflow much faster and more professional.\n## Problem\n1. **Lack of Bridge:** There is no official extension that facilitates sending URLs.\n2. **Window Redundancy:** When clicking a `kingo://` link with the app already open, Windows tries to open a second instance of Kingo, resulting in two windows and a database concurrency error.\n## Technical Proposal\n### 1. Browser Extension (Kingo Bridge)\n* Create an extension (Manifest v3) compatible with Chrome, Edge, and Brave.\n* Add a \"Ba",

      "description": "## Context\nKingo has matured and its current architecture in Wails v2 is starting to limit the \"Native App\" experience. Migrating to v3 Alpha/Beta is the necessary step to transform Kingo into a robust and cross-platform system utility.\n## Motivation\nv3 brings primary support for **Multi-window**, which is crucial for our notification and overlay system. In addition, the new Wails v3 API is much closer to the native capabilities of the OS (Windows/Mac/Linux), allowing for deep integration with the system that v2 does not achieve without \"hacks\".\n## Current Problem (v2 Limitations)\n1. **Limited Notifications:** Currently our Toasts (like the Clipboard one) live \"inside\" the main window. If the app is minimized, the user sees nothing.\n2. **Lifecycle:** The control of Single Instance and system events (such as suspend/resume) are less elegant in v2.\n3. **Tray and Menus:** v3 offers much superior control over the system tray and menus of",
